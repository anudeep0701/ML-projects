The application area of the project focuses on the public health and health condition of a patient. The goal is to predict whether the person is likely to get a stroke or not, which is a binary classification task.

## Abstract
Stroke is a disease that affects approximately 6.3 mil-lion people globally. Itâ€™s the second deadliest disease recorded by the World Health Organization. The purpose of the study is to determine the probability of someone suffering a stroke. The work carried out by traditional methods in detecting the stroke involves manual effort and a cumbersome process in selecting the required features for analysis. We make use of Ma-chine learning algorithms to estimate the outcome. We used KNN, Random forest, Decision trees, Support Vector Machine, and XGBclassifier to train for accurate prediction of how likely a person is having a stroke or not. The best performance was shown by the Random Forest model with a precision of 93% approximately.
